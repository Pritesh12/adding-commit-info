Another popular approach that was popular in with Grails 2.x was to utilize the https://grails.org/plugin/build-info[Build Info Plugin]
The build-info plugin works by utilizing the environment variables available via a build system like Jenkins.

* BUILD_NUMBER
* BUILD_ID
* BUILD_TAG
* SVN_REVISION
* GIT_COMMIT
* GIT_BRANCH

These properties would then be available by accessing the `/buildInfo` endpoint.
