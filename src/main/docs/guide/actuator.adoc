Now that we have the git commit info captured and included in our application via a `git.properties` file, it is time to utilize it.

Grails 3.x is based on Spring Boot and we can leverage some of the underlying tools already included in the application.

include::{commondir}/common-quoteSpringBootActuator.adoc[]

Built into Spring boot is a module called `spring-boot-actuator` that provides these endpoints.
The endpoints are disabled by default so the first step is to enabled them.

'''

If you open up `grails-app/conf/application.yml` you will find a block of configuration that looks like this:

```yaml
# Spring Actuator Endpoints are Disabled by Default
endpoints:
    enabled: false
    jmx:
        enabled: true
```

You simply have to enable the actuator endpoints by setting *`enabled: true`*

```yaml
# Spring Actuator Endpoints are Disabled by Default
endpoints:
    enabled: true
    jmx:
        enabled: true
```
