Grails 2.x and below has an `application.properties` that can be utilized to store commit properties.
This is the same place that Grails used to store its application name and version.

In this example some mechanism needs to be in place to append/update the commit info to the `application.properties`
It could be the build system that appends git commit info as a build step before producing a war.

After the commit info is added to `application.properties` We can access that metadata in several ways:

* GrailsApplication via `grailsApplication.metadata['git.sha']`
* Utilizing the taglib `<g:meta name='git.sha'/>` in a view.
