You may not have wanted to enable _all_ of the default actuator endpoints.
If you wanted to just enable the info endpoint you'll want to set `endpoints.info.enabled=true` via config and leave `endpoints.enabled=false`:
```yaml
# Spring Actuator Endpoints are Disabled by Default
endpoints:
    enabled: false
    info:
        enabled: true
```

CAUTION: You should be aware that enabling the actuator endpoints opens up several endpoints that you may not want to exposed.
You may have to secure or disable them:

.Actuator Endpoints enabled by default
