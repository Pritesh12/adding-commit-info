You may not have wanted to enable _all_ of the default actuator endpoints.
If you wanted to just enable the info endpoint you'll want to set `endpoints.info.enabled=true` via config and leave `endpoints.enabled=false`:
```yaml
# Spring Actuator Endpoints are Disabled by Default
endpoints:
    enabled: false
    info:
        enabled: true
```

CAUTION: You should be aware that enabling the _all_ off the actuator endpoints might open up several endpoints that you may not want to exposed.
Some of the endpoints expose sensitive information and you may have to secure or disable them. Consult the documentation for more info http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html
