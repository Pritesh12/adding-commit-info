Adding git commit information to your application is handy for debugging and transparency.  The default simple mode only exposes the sha, time and branch name.
There are some organizations who would would prefer to restrict commit info even further in their more sensitive environments.

One approach is to leverage http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/conf.html#environments[per-environment configuration]
to enable/disable and configure the endpoints differently according to the environment.
For example if you only wanted simple mode enabled in production you might use the following config:

[source,yaml]
./complete/grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[lines=103]
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[lines=112..116]
----
